## Read-07: Domain Modeling, Tables, Functions, Methods and Objects

**Tables**

- A table represents information in a grid form/layout

``` 
<table>
 Used to create a table
<tr>
Used to indicate the start of a new row
<td>
Stands for table data, refers to each table cell
<th>
Stands for table heading
```
You can span columns `colspan` and rows `rowspan` to multiple cells

For long tables you can split into `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`

**Domain Modeling**

The process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem.

When modeling a single entity that will have many instances use a constructor function to build self-contained objects with the same attributes.

Methods should be small and have a singluar job.

**Tables**

- A tabe represents information in a grid format.

- Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.

- Each block of the grid is referred to as a table cell.

**Basic Table Structure**
```
<table>
  <tr> //table row
    <th></th>  //table heading
    <td></td>  //table cell
    <td></td>  
  </tr>
</table>
```
The `<th>` element is a heading for a column or row and is utilized by screen readers to improve accessability.

- Spanning Columns: spanning multiple horizontal cells.
  - `<td colspan="3">` 
- Spanning Rows: spanning multiple vertical cells.
  - `<tr rowspan='2'>`

- For better accessability and styling purposes it is best to use the following elements on longer tables.
  - `<thread>` is used to wrap the `<tr><th>`
  - `<tbody>` wraps the first set of `<tr><td>`
  - `<tfoot>` wraps the last set of `<tr><td>`


**JS Notes**

**Constructors**

- The `new` keyword and the **object constructor** create a blank object that you can then add properties and methods to.
  - Create and object with the `new` keywords and `Object()` constructor.
    - `var exampleName = new Object();`
  - Add properties and methods using **dot notation**.
    - ```
      exampleName.p1 = 'something';
      exampleName.p2 = 'something else';
      exampleName.m1 = function(){
        //do a thing
      }
      ```
- You can create an empty object with literal notation `var name = {}`.

- Update objects with **dot notation** or **square brackets**
  - `exampleName.p1 = 'a different thing';`
  - `exampleName['p2'] = 'excelsior';`
    - Square brackets is required when using a variable instead of the key name.
- `delete exampleName.p1;` will remove the property.

**Creating Multiple Objects**

> Object constructors can use a function as a **template** for creating objects.

- ```
  function Store(name, minCust, maxCust) {
    this.storeName = name;
    this.minimumCustomers = minCust;
    this.maximumCustomers = maxCust;
    this.someMethod = function() {
      // do a thing
    }
  }
  ```
  - `.this` is used instead of the object name to indicate the key belongs to the object that *this* function creates.
  - Each statement uses a `;` unlike literal notation.
  - The constructor function name begins with a capital letter.

  - The `new` keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object.
    - `var newStore = new Store('S'Mart', 10, 30);`

- When a function is created in the global scope `.this` refers to the window object.
- Global variables also become properties of the window object.
- In a method `.this` refers to the object the key lives in.

> Arrays are a special type of object.  They hold key/value pairs but the key for each value is an index number.

**Objects**

1. Browser Object Model
  - Contains objects that represent the current browser window such as browser history and the device's screen.
2. Document Object Model
  -the DOM uses objects to create a representation of the current page.
3. Global JavaScript Objects
  - Things that JavaScript needs to create a model of.

> An **Object Model** is a group of objects that form a model of something larger.
